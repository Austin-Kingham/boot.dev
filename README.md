# In the countdown_to_blastoff function, write a loop that counts down from 10 to 1. At each iteration, print the number with an ellipsis:

# i...

# However, when i is 1, it should print 1...Blastoff! instead.

    for i in range(10, 0, -1):
        if i == 1:

        else:
            print(f"{i}...")

# Lets say this is the terminal. If I ran my code it would look like this:
